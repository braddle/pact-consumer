# Pact contract testing (Consumer)

Playing with [Pact](https://docs.pact.io) to test an API consumer written in PHP using 
[PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit) and 
[Pact PHP](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-php) to ensure the code interacts with the API Provider server
in the way we expect it to.
